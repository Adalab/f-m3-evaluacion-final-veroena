### Veronica Enamorado - Adalab Fairfax Promo Final Evaluation

This is a website for the final evaluation on Adalab to practice React JS. Consists of a web page with a list of Harry Potter characters that you can filter by name or house. When you click on the character, a new card will be shown, using React Router.


## Available Scripts
